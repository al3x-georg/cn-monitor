# :rocket: Project Overview

This project contains the configuration files implemented in the Diploma Thesis of [Alexandros Georgopoulos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandros-georgopoulos-296a991b6), Graduate Student of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en).

## :bulb: Thesis Presentation

The Thesis presentation can be found in the "[Thesis presentation](https://github.com/al3x-georg/cn-monitor/tree/main/Thesis%20presentation)" folder, available in both English and German. It concisely outlines the objectives of the Thesis and provides an overview of the software and services utilized in the Diploma Thesis.

## :page_facing_up: Thesis Report

The Thesis report is located in the "[Thesis report](https://github.com/al3x-georg/cn-monitor/tree/main/Thesis%20report)" section and is written in Greek.

## :gear: Configuration Files

For each service, the corresponding configuration files can be accessed in the "[Configuration files](https://github.com/al3x-georg/cn-monitor/tree/main/Configuration%20files)" section. Inside that folder, you'll find the "[Prometheus Alertmanager rules](https://github.com/al3x-georg/cn-monitor/tree/main/Configuration%20files/Prometheus%20Alertmanager/Prometheus%20Alertmanager%20rules)" section, which contains the Prometheus alerting rules for each Exporter utilized in the project. Kibana Dashboards can be found in the [dedicated section](https://github.com/al3x-georg/cn-monitor/tree/main/Kibana%20Dashboards), while Grafana Dashboards are available in the "[Grafana Dashboards](https://github.com/al3x-georg/cn-monitor/tree/main/Grafana%20Dashboards)" folder.

## :scroll: How to Add Targets to Prometheus

Step-by-step instructions on adding targets to Prometheus for each exporter can be found in the "[How to add targets to Prometheus](https://github.com/al3x-georg/cn-monitor/tree/main/How%20to%20add%20targets%20to%20Prometheus)" section.

## :star: **Abstract of Diploma Thesis**

Undoubtedly, being aware of the weaknesses of a system, as well as the possible malfunctions that can occur, is a powerful tool for making the most of a system's potential. However, this awareness is linked to the process of monitoring an infrastructure.

The term monitoring refers to the process of supervising elements and units of a system, through the collection of data. Thus, the next step to that methodology lays emphasis on the analysis of these visualization methods, with the ambition being an optimal exploitation of infrastructure resources.

The "Alerting" mechanism contributes to the above approach, and specifically to the supervision and prevention of potential risks, during which notifications such as emails are sent to quickly inform the system administrators in the event of a possible service interruption.

The first part of the thesis outlines the design of the monitoring system, as well as the elements and software it includes.

The second part of the thesis describes the detailed way of installing and configuring the software and services that are used, in order to operate efficiently and reliably with each other.
